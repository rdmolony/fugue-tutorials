    "# Interfaceless\n",

    "Fugue does have interfaces for all these extensions. But in most of the cases, you don't have to implement these interfaces, instead, Fugue will adapt to your functions and wrap them under these interfaces.\n",
    "\n",
    "One obvious benefit is that most of your code can be totally independent from Fugue. It's not like other computing frameworks, you have to implement their interfaces and use their data structures, and the dependency will spread in your code, it will be hard to move away from them, and testing is also difficult and slow.\n",
    "\n",
    "Actually a more important benefit is that, it helps you separate your logics. What can be independent from the computing framework? What has to depend on that? How to minimize the dependency? When you use Fugue, you naturally think more about these design questions. And with the interfaceless feature, you will be able to achieve them elegantly. Even someday you decide to move away from Fugue, you should find it's simple and the Fugue mindset will still be beneficial when you move into another framework.\n",
    "\n",
    "To be interfaceless, you must have type annotations for your python code so Fugue can understand what you want. Writing python code with type hints are in general regarded as good practice. If you are not familiar, read [PEP 483](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0483/), [PEP 484](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0484/), [typing module](https://docs.python.org/3/library/typing.html) and [mypy](http://mypy-lang.org/).\n",

    "\n",
    "Fugue is able to wrap these 3 functions to Fugue Transformers, and at runtime, the data will be passed in according to the type annotations. Also notice the comment line before `transformer3`, it is to tell Fugue the output schema of the transformation. For `transformer1` and `transformer2` you will need to specify the schema in the Fugue code.\n",
    "\n",
    "These 3 transformers can achieve the same thing, but with the flexibility of input and output, you may write much more intuitive and less tedious code and let Fugue handle the rest.\n",
    "\n",
    "Also with flexibile input and output, Fugue is able to optimize the execution. For example, with iterable input, Fugue will not preload the entire partition in memory, and you can exit the iteration any time. And with pd.DataFrame as input and output, you will get best performance when using [SparkExecutionEngine with pandas_udf](../advanced/useful_config.ipynb#Use-Pandas-UDF-on-SparkExecutionEngine) enabled, because pandas_udf itself requires pd.DataFrame as input and output, so your annotation eliminates data conversion.\n",
